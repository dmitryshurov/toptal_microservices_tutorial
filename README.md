# About

This is the code for my "Streamline Event-Driven Microservices With Kafka and Python" for Toptal blog.

# Running the code

1. Set up [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/).
2. Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file to an `.env` file and fill in the variables from Confluent Cloud.
3. Install Python3 and the required dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run `python3 simple_producer.py` or `python3 advanced_producer.py` to test the producer.
